                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>In 1974 Oregon, a young girl with a Polaroid camera follows a mysterious voice and encounters an
                    erratic man in pale makeup.

                    Twenty years later, FBI agent Lee Harker, who exhibits possible clairvoyance, is assigned by her
                    supervisor William Carter to a case involving a series of murder–suicides in Oregon. Each case
                    involves a father killing his family and himself, leaving behind a letter with Satanic coding signed
                    "Longlegs", whose handwriting belongs to none of the family members. Lee discovers that each family
                    had a nine-year-old daughter born on the 14th of the month, the murders all occurred within six days
                    before or after the birthday itself, and the murders form an occult triangle symbol on a calendar,
                    with one date missing. While talking to her mother Ruth, Lee receives a coded birthday card from
                    Longlegs, warning her that revealing the source of the code will lead to her mother's murder.

                    Following a clue, Lee and Carter find a doll with a high-energy metal orb inside. After visiting a
                    mental hospital to question Carrie Anne Camera, the sole survivor of Longlegs's attacks, who was
                    visited previously by someone using Lee's name, Carter suspects Lee's connection to Longlegs.
                    Discovering that Ruth had filed a police report of an intruder approaching Lee the day before her
                    ninth birthday, Carter encourages Lee to talk to her. Ruth directs Lee to childhood belongings,
                    where she finds a Polaroid of the pale-faced man, revealing Longlegs to be the man who had visited a
                    young Lee on her birthday. Lee submits the photo, leading to Longlegs's arrest. Realizing the
                    missing date is that day, Lee fears an accomplice will commit another murder. In the interrogation
                    room, Longlegs claims to serve "the man downstairs" and hints at Ruth's involvement before killing
                    himself. Lee is soon informed that Carrie has committed suicide.

                    Agent Browning drives Lee to her mother's home, where Lee witnesses Ruth kill Browning with a
                    shotgun. Ruth then destroys a doll resembling young Lee, causing Lee to lose consciousness. Lee sees
                    that Ruth has been Longlegs's accomplice since her childhood. Longlegs forced Ruth to choose between
                    her daughter's death and his bidding, leading her to comply and spare Lee. Longlegs has lived in the
                    Harker basement, creating Satanic dolls that Ruth, posing as a nun, delivered to households, causing
                    the patriarchs to commit familicide. Lee's doll blocked her memories of Longlegs whilst influencing
                    her with his magic.

                    Lee awakens in the basement and hears a demonic voice on the phone warning her about William
                    Carter's daughter Ruby's ninth birthday party, which had been scheduled for that day. Lee rushes to
                    save the Carters, whose deaths would complete Longlegs's triangle. She finds the family already
                    possessed, with Ruth having delivered the doll. After William kills his wife Anna, Lee shoots him to
                    protect Ruby. Ruth attacks with a dagger, forcing Lee to kill her. Lee tries to destroy the doll but
                    her gun does not discharge. Staring at the doll, she tells Ruby they need to leave.

            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>The film was announced in November 2022, with Osgood Perkins as writer and director.[7] He drew
                inspiration from several sources; the plot device of the evil dolls that cause fathers to murder their
                families was loosely inspired by the killing of JonBenét Ramsey: "The murder took place approaching
                Christmas, and one present that the parents had gotten for JonBenét was a life-size replica doll of
                herself, wearing one of her pageant dresses. It was in a cardboard box in the basement, 15 feet from
                where she was killed, and there was something so insane about that, I'd cataloged it away."[8]
                <br>
                <br>
                Perkins told People magazine that the film was inspired by his mother's treatment towards father Anthony
                Perkins's sexuality, shielding the public and the Perkins children from knowledge of his homosexual
                relationships. Oz Perkins was quoted, saying, "Your mother can protect you from a truth that she thinks
                is unsavory...And then you just build out a crazy movie around that.”[9]
                <br>
                <br>
                In February 2023, Nicolas Cage and Maika Monroe came on board to star, with Cage also producing under
                his Saturn Films banner.[10][11] In March, Alicia Witt and Blair Underwood were announced as part of the
                cast.[12]

                <br>
                Dave Caplan's C2 Motion Picture Group financed the film for under $10 million.[2] Principal photography
                was scheduled to take place in Vancouver from January 16 to February 23, 2023.

            <h2>Marketing</h2>
            <p>Neon used guerilla marketing tactics similar to those that led to the box office success of The Blair
                Witch Project (1999), building speculation through clips, images, and coded messages that used symbology
                created for the film and concealed Cage's look as Longlegs.[17] Eleven promotional videos were uploaded
                to YouTube leading up to release, the first appearing in January 2024, which did not mention the film's
                title until February; together, the videos accumulated 30 million views.[2][18][19] A trailer was
                attached to every horror film released in theaters since January 2024.[2]

                <br>
                Additional content included a billboard (with no mention of the title) that featured a phone number for
                pre-recorded messages from the film's antagonist,[20] and a paid advertisement featuring a cipher that
                was published in the Seattle Times on June 14, a reference to the Zodiac Killer, that directed readers
                to an in-universe website detailing murders committed in the film.[21] The week of the film's release,
                Neon released a clip allegedly of Monroe's heartrate when she first saw Cage's character.[22] Following
                the film's theatrical premiere, Neon released another promotional spot highlighting hidden appearances
                of the devil that recur in the backgrounds of the film.[23] According to Perkins, there are 15
                appearances of the devil in the film which are not readily noticeable.[24]
                <br>
                <br>
                Perkins credited Neon for the film's marketing, saying the studio "asked me early on, 'Do we have your
                permission to kind of go nuts?' And I said, 'What else are we doing here? Go for it. Do your
                thing.'"[25] The film's total marketing budget was under $10 million, focusing on using digital content
                over traditional television ads.</p>
