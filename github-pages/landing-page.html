    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 3rd year CTD major. I started off college as a CS major up until fall of 2023. I found I did not enjoy an
        ounce of the work and classes in the CS department and explored my options for a few months. I made my final
        decision on switch to CTD and have found a new enjoyment in my work. I am a child of Vietnamese immigrants and
        victims of war.

    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>
        I enjoy watching and playing sports. I have played floor hockey, flag football, soccer, baseball, and ran
        track competitively. I'm passionate about playing video games and play for the CU Boulder Esports team. I've
        been playing for the school since my freshman year. I've played against other colleges in the PAC division and
        West division. I have played video games since I was 6 and my first console was the Wii.
