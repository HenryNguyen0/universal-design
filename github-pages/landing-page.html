    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 3rd year CTD major. I started off college as a CS major up until fall of 2023. I found I did not enjoy an
        ounce of the work and classes in the CS department and explored my options for a few months. I made my final
        decision on switch to CTD and have found a new enjoyment in my work. I am a child of Vietnamese immigrants and
        victims of war.
