        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 3rd year CTD major. I started off college as a CS major up until fall of 2023. I found I did not enjoy
            an
            ounce of the work and classes in the CS department and explored my options for a few months. I made my final
            decision on switch to CTD and have found a new enjoyment in my work. I am a child of Vietnamese immigrants.
            <br>
            <br>
            I enjoy playing soccer and watching other sports. I like living in suburb areas. I don't like too much of
            the city life but I can't live in extremely quiet areas either. I enjoy trying new Asian restaurants around
            Denver and Aurora. My favorite restaurants are "Old Town Hotspot" and "Sakana Ramen".
