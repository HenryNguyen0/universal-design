                <h2>Introduction</h2>                

                <p>Minions is a 2015 American animated comedy film produced by Universal Pictures and Illumination
                    Entertainment, and distributed by Universal. The film is a prequel to Despicable Me (2010) and the
                    third
                    installment overall in the Despicable Me franchise. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda,
                    produced
                    by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, and written by Brian Lynch, Minions stars the voices of Coffin
                    as
                    the titular beings (including Kevin, Stuart, and Bob), Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton,
                    Allison
                    Janney, Steve Coogan, Jennifer Saunders, and Geoffrey Rush as the narrator. In the film, the Minions
                    search for their replaceable evil master after accidentally killing all of those in history.

                    Minions debuted in London on June 11, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 10. It
                    received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the animation, voice acting, and score, but
                    criticized
                    the character development and humor, which some called unfunny and inappropriate. Coffin has also
                    expressed displeasure in the final film. The film grossed $1.159 billion worldwide, finishing its
                    theatrical run as fifth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the second-highest-grossing animated film
                    of
                    all time. It also became the highest-grossing film produced by Illumination until it was surpassed
                    by
                    The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023. With its effect on popular culture, the success of Minions
                    spawned
                    two sequels: Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022) and Minions 3 (2027).

                <h2>Plot</h2>
                <p>
                    Minions are small, yellow pill-shaped creatures which have existed since the beginning of time,
                    evolving
                    from single-celled organisms into beings which exist only to serve history's most evil masters, but
                    they
                    accidentally end up killing all their masters: rolling a Tyrannosaurus into a volcano, letting a
                    caveman
                    get mauled by a bear, crushing a Pharaoh and his subjects with a pyramid, and exposing Count Dracula
                    to
                    sunlight. They are driven into isolation after firing a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia and start
                    a
                    new life inside a cave, but after many years, the Minions become sad and unmotivated without a
                    master to
                    serve. This prompts three Minions; named Kevin, Stuart and Bob, to go out on a quest to find a new
                    master for their brethren to follow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The three journey in 1968 to New York City and stay at a department store for the night, where they
                    come
                    across a hidden commercial broadcast advertising Villain-Con, an Orlando convention for all
                    villains.
                    The next day, they hitchhike a ride with the Nelsons, a family of thieves. At the convention, they
                    meet
                    Scarlet Overkill, the world's first female supervillain, who unexpectedly hires them and takes them
                    to
                    her home in London. They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join. Scarlet plans to steal
                    the
                    Imperial State Crown from Queen Elizabeth II, promising to reward the Minions if they succeed, but
                    also
                    threatening to kill them if they fail.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Scarlet's husband Herb supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught
                    while breaking into the Tower of London. During the subsequent chase, Bob runs into the Sword in the
                    Stone and pulls the sword free to defend himself and his friends, removing the Queen from the throne
                    and
                    making Bob the new King. Enraged that someone else accomplished her dream of stealing the throne,
                    Scarlet confronts Bob, who voluntarily abdicates the throne in her favor. Undeterred, Scarlet
                    imprisons
                    Kevin, Stuart and Bob in a dungeon, where Herb attempts to torture the trio, but they escape with
                    the
                    intention to apologize to Scarlet at her coronation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After making their way to Westminster Abbey, Kevin, Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by
                    inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet. Mistaking the accident for an assassination attempt,
                    Scarlet angrily orders the trio's execution and has other villains chase them through the streets of
                    London during a thunderstorm. Stuart and Bob are captured, while Kevin hides in a pub and sees
                    Scarlet
                    on television, who declares that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn.
                    With
                    the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons and
                    triggers a
                    machine Herb was building, causing him to grow in size into a giant. Kevin tramples through London,
                    rescues his friends and battles Scarlet, just as the other Minions turn up in the city. Scarlet
                    tries to
                    eradicate them by firing a massive missile, but Kevin swallows it. Scarlet and Herb attempt to
                    escape
                    with her rocket dress, only for Kevin to hold onto it and get pulled into the sky. The missile
                    explodes,
                    seemingly killing Kevin, Scarlet and Herb. As the Minions mourn the loss of their leader, Kevin
                    survives
                    after returning to his normal size.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Queen gets her throne and crown back. She rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear Tim,
                    Stuart with an electric guitar, and Kevin with a knighthood. Scarlet and Herb, still alive, steal
                    the
                    crown again, only to be stopped by a young Gru, who fires a freeze ray at them and flees with the
                    crown
                    on a rocket-powered motorcycle. The Minions run after him, deciding he is the master they were
                    looking
                    for.

                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Development of Minions was greenlit in July 2012,[11] after writer Brian Lynch recognized the
                    popularity of Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, a simulator ride.[12] Pierre Coffin became director again
                    with newcomer Kyle Balda as the co-director, marking the first film in the franchise where Chris
                    Renaud is not a director. Eric Guillon returned for the film but was not an art director, as he was
                    the character and production designer for the film.
                </p>
                <h3>Casting</h3>
                <p>
                    In February 2013, Sandra Bullock joined the cast to voice Scarlet Overkill,[6] with Jon Hamm joining
                    two months later as her husband Herb Overkill.[7] Bullock was paid $10 million for her
                    involvement.[13] In March 2015, Allison Janney was cast as Madge Nelson.[9] Pierre Coffin, the
                    film's director, reprised his role as the Minions. This is one of the films in the franchise in
                    which Coffin is the lead actor and the first film where Chris Renaud doesn't serve as a director,
                    but an executive producer. Kyle Balda served as a co-director along with Coffin. Jennifer Saunders
                    was cast to voice Queen Elizabeth II.
