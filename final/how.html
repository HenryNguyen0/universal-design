                <h3>CSS Responsive Layout</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS Grid is a layout tool that not only simplifies web design but also significantly improves web
                    accessibility. By structuring content in a clear, logical, and adaptable manner, Grid helps create
                    user
                    interfaces that are inclusive and usable for a diverse audience. Accessibility encompasses
                    considerations
                    for users with disabilities, those using assistive technologies, and anyone navigating under
                    constrained
                    circumstances, such as low bandwidth or small screens.
                </p>

                <h3>Web Standards & HTML Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    Web standards are a set of guidelines and best practices established by organizations like the World
                    Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). These standards dictate how
                    web content and technologies should be implemented to ensure interoperability, usability, and
                    accessibility for all users. <br>
                    <br>
                    Web standards and proper HTML coding are critical to creating websites that are inclusive,
                    performant, and easy to maintain. By adhering to standards and employing semantic HTML, developers
                    can ensure their websites provide a seamless and accessible experience for all users while
                    future-proofing their work for evolving web technologies.
                </p>

                <h3>Structure and Semantics</h3>
                <p>
                    Effective web design hinges on organizing and presenting information in a way that is accessible and
                    intuitive for users. One critical aspect of achieving this is ensuring that applicable items are
                    made visible, while non-relevant operations are hidden or not presented at all. This idea is central
                    to creating a seamless user experience, particularly in electronic interfaces such as websites and
                    software applications. <br>
                    <br>
                    When a website or application is first loaded, presenting users with an overwhelming number of
                    options on the main screen can be counterproductive. Instead, hierarchical menu systems are used to
                    group information into major categories. As users drill down into more specific areas, additional
                    options are revealed, helping them focus on relevant tasks. This approach is called context
                    sensitivity, where the visibility of certain controls is based on the user's location in the system. <br>
                    <br>
                    An example of context sensitivity in practice is progressive disclosure, a concept commonly used in
                    web design. Progressive disclosure involves showing users only the basic operations initially, and
                    revealing more complex features upon user request. For instance, search interfaces often provide a
                    simple search bar with an option to access advanced search features. This creates a simpler and more
                    approachable interface for novice users while offering advanced users more control over their tasks.
