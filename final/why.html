                <h3>Diversity of Users</h3>
                <p>Universal Design and web accessibility directly impact the lives of over one
                    billion people worldwide who live with disabilities, alongside others who face temporary
                    or situational limitations. People are excluded from essential services, education,
                    employment opportunities, and social connections due to inaccessible digital design. When a website
                    isn't properly structured for screen readers, a blind person can't apply for a job. When videos lack
                    captions, deaf users miss critical information. When interfaces require precise mouse movements,
                    people with motor impairments can't access important services. This is
                    about recognizing that all users, from elderly individuals to non-native language speakers, deserve
                    equal access to digital resources.

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their physical, sensory, cognitive, or
                    situational limitations, has equal access to digital content and services. By addressing diverse
                    needs, we foster a more inclusive society where people with disabilities can fully participate in
                    education, work, and social activities. In many countries, accessibility is a legal requirement
                    under frameworks like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S., the Web Content
                    Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and the European Accessibility Act. Non-compliance can lead to
                    lawsuits, penalties, and reputational damage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accessibility drives innovation. Features like voice recognition, text-to-speech, and touch
                    interfaces were initially designed for accessibility but are now widely used by everyone.
                    Prioritizing accessibility can lead to new ideas that benefit a broader audience.
                </p>

                <h3>Benefits of Web Standards</h3>
                <p>
                    The Web Standards Project (WaSP) emerged in 1998 to address inconsistencies in web development that
                    created barriers for users, particularly those relying on assistive technologies. At the time,
                    websites often catered to specific browsers, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator,
                    resulting in fragmented user experiences. This lack of standardization disproportionately affected
                    individuals with disabilities and others who depended on alternative means of accessing web content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main issues was how web developers used HTML. For example, they often relied on
                    non-semantic tags, like
                /table/, to control the layout of a webpage. While visually effective, this method confused screen
                    readers, which are designed to navigate through well-structured content. Users with visual
                    impairments struggled because the underlying structure of these pages did not convey the intended
                    relationships between elements.
