                <h3>What is Universal Design?</h3>
                <p>Universal Design is a approach to creating products and interfaces that work for
                    everyone, accessible by anyone no matter their ability. The core principles include equal use,
                    flexibility, and simple intuitive design. These principles ensure that digital products are
                    accessible to all users, whether they're using assistive technologies, have different levels of
                    technical expertise, or face temporary or permanent disabilities. A well-designed
                    website should work equally well for someone using a screen reader, keyboard navigation, or
                    traditional mouse input.

                <h3>Norman's Design Concepts</h3>
                <p>
                    Norman's Design Concepts complement these principles by focusing on intuitive user interaction
                    through visibility, feedback, and constraints. Good design makes features clearly visible, provides
                    immediate response for user actions, and prevents errors through appropriate constraints. A form
                    should clearly show required fields, confirm when information is successfully submitted, and prevent
                    users from submitting incomplete or incorrect information. When combined with Universal Design
                    principles and accessibility guidelines, these concepts create interfaces that accessible and usable
                    by anyone.

                <h3>Website Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Website accessibility, guided by WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), focuses on four
                    essential principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. This means that content
                    must be presented in ways that users can understand, like providing text alternatives for images.
                    Users must be able to operate the interface through keyboard navigation. Content must be
                    understandable with clear instructions, and the code must be robust enough to work with current and
                    future assistive technologies. These guidelines are crucial for ensuring digital equality and often
                    required by law in many countries.
